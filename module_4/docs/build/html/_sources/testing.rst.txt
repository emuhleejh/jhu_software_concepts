Specific Test Run
-----------------------
Each test is labeled with a mark, and can be run grouped with other tests of the same mark.

To run a group of tests with a specific mark, run: 
``pytest -m "mark"`` 
within the active directory, replacing "mark" with a valid option from below.

Available marks:
* web — page load / HTML structure
* buttons — button endpoints & busy-state behavior
* analysis — labels and percentage formatting
* db — database schema/inserts/selects
* integration — end-to-end flows

Test Doubles
-----------------------
Tests reference sample data and interact with a test database to keep live data and database isolated from tests.
Tests use Monkeypatch to create mock functions that interact with sample data and test database, including pulling data, loading data, and querying data.

Test Fixtures
-----------------------
Test fixtures connect to the main app for proper testing, and configure the app to be in a testing state.

Comments: We have completed our initial round of admission review. At least two faculty and in certain cases up to five faculty have independently reviewed your files and jointly made recommendation. Unfortunately, we cannot make an offer to you right now. 

However, there is some probability we will be able to offer you admission, but it will likely not be until early April (my best estimate at this moment, possibly earlier, possibly later, possibly never). I know this process can be quite stressful and I sincerely ask for your patience.
